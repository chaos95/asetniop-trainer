# ASETNIOP Trainer
This is a simple demo written in [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org) for the [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/index.html). Practice your [ASETNIOP](https://www.asetniop.com/) chords on any QWERTY keyboard on this simple typerwriter interface.

## To run
1. Check out the repo
2. Load the directory as `/usr` on your Mini Micro
3. `load "typewriter.ms"`
4. `run`

## How to write with ASETNIOP
This demo binds the ASETNIOP keys to the standard keyboard keys QWERUIOP.

## Caveats
* The dictionary currently only implements the base two-key pairs that produce the alphabet and some basic symbols. 
* This is not built for distribution etc yet, so there's no github actions, no itch page, etc. For now it's just a basic proof-of-concept. I intend to turn it into more of a game as I go.
* PRs/issues welcome. Please note - I am a father of 4 who works full time, so I may not respond super quick, but I'll try my best :)
